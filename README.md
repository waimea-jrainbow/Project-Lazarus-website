# Lazarus codex

## A website that lays out information about project lazarus
Project lazarus is a roblox game based on call of duty zombies. I will be pulling information from the Lazarus fandom page however there are some things that I and my friends who play the game wish were available.


This website will:
* Have a introduction homepage with an updates feed and links to project lazarus related pages like the roblox page and the official discord
* A page attached to a database that will list all the weapons in the game and the ability to open a detailed page for each separate weapon and must include how many rounds it will last
* A calculator for the damage dealt by weapons when multiplied by different multipliers
